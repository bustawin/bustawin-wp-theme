# bustawin theme
The wordpress theme of the bustawin website. It is a child theme of [UnderStrap](https://github.com/understrap/understrap).

## Developing
Requirements: node **10**

1. `npm install yarn`

This leaves the CSS at `/css` folder. Note that wordpress oly wants `/css/child-theme.min.css`.
